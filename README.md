# COVID-19 Trend Prediction and Analysis
CSE163 20SU Final Project at UW

## Motivation and background:
As the health crisis triggered by the pandemic COVID-19 keeps the world in its grasp, most people are forced to work from home as well as to practice social distancing. Our project could potentially foretell how future pandemics are going. It will focus on how different government policies affect the spread of this virus. We will visualize the virus spread with respect to different regions/countries and analyze how the virus spread is correlated to different geolocations, and see how the projection of infected cases will be like in the near future. 

Our modeling and forecasting could potentially help evaluate the course of the pandemic. It could also provide insightful ideas to the governments on how different implementations of public health measures may impact the spread. In a narrow sense, investigating the relationship between local income level and rate of infection and fatality could help us specifically understand the situation in our community. The information could be used to make more adaptive policies, since current guidelines from the federal government are drafted in the national scale while COVID-19 did not hit every state at the same time. With real-time geographical visualizations of the virus spread, we could efficiently avoid visitors traveling to those regions/countries to help reduce COVID-19 spread. Future predictions of region spread may help the government or associated organizations pay more attention to specific regions and take effective measures.
